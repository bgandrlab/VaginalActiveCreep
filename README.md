# VaginalActiveCreep
Experimental data for active and passive creep of the murine vagina.

**Study Objective**

To develop methods to evaluate the contribution of smooth muscle to vaginal creep under multiaxial loading using extension â€“ inflation tests.

**Experimental Data** 

Set#1: Potassium Chloride (KCl) Depedent Creep

Filename: Set1_Creep_KCl_WT

Creep data is provided in an excel spreadsheet. It reports the time (in seconds) and outer diameter (in millimeters). The  outer diameter is reported when activated with 4.7 mM KCl (basal), 20 mM KCl, 40 mM KCl, and 0 mM KCl (passive), then subjected to 7 mmHg of pressure. There is a total of 10 samples.

Set#2: Pressure Depedent Creep

Filename:Set2_Creep_Press_WT

Creep data is provided in an excel spreadsheet. It reports the time (in seconds) and outer diameter (in millimeters). The  outer diameter is reported when activated with 40 mM KCl (active), then subject to 5 and 15 mmHg of pressure. The  outer diameter is reported when  passive (0 mM KCl), then subjected to 5 and 15 mmHg of pressure. There is a total of 5 samples.
