# VaginalActiveCreep
Experimental data for active and passive creep of the murine vagina.

#Study Objective
To develop methods to evaluate the contribution of smooth muscle to vaginal
creep under multiaxial loading using extension â€“ inflation tests

#Experimental Data 
Set#1: Potassium Chloride (KCl) Depedent Creep
Creep data is provided in an excel spreadsheet. It reports the time (in seconds) and outer diamater (in millimeters). The  outer diameter is reported when activated with 4.7 mM KCl (basal), 20 mM KCl, 40 mM KCl, and 0 mM KCl (passive). There is a total of 10 samples.

Set#2: Pressure Depedent Creep
